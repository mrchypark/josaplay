The goal of josaplay is to provide functions to add josa in Korean text. It is useful with Rmarkdown.

## Installation

```r
# CRAN version
install.packages("josaplay")

# Dev version
install.packages("josaplay", repos = "https://mrchypark.r-universe.dev")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

### v0.2.0

Breaking change from v0.1.3. 

```{r}
library(josaplay)
# 과/와
josa("상품", "과")
josa("상품", "와")
josa("텀블러", "과")
josa("텀블러", "와")

# number
josa("145", "이")
josa("k146", "이")
```

### support josa

을 / 를    
은 / 는    
이 / 가    
과 / 와    
이나 / 나    
으로 / 로    
아 / 야    
이랑 / 랑    
이며 / 며    
이다 / 다    
이가 / 가    
 
* All josa can use `select` param on `josa(textko, select)` but `가` is work as only `이/가` not `이가/가`.
